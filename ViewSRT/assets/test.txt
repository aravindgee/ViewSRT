3

And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:03,141
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:07,729
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:12,275
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

8
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:19,825

with another boyfriend.

9

They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,958

take advantage of her.

11
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:32,170
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:36,508
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:38,343 --> 00:01:43,306

her nose was broken,

14

to three years in prison,

25

You never wanted my friendship.

You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

45

You didn't need a friend like me.

46
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:46,823
But now you come to me and say,

47
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:49,367
" Don Corleone, give me justice. "

48
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:54,080
But you don't ask with respect.

49
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:58,877
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

50
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:07,510
You come on my daughter's wedding

00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:35,484
You never said
you knew Johnny Fontane!

175
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:39,613
-Sure. You want to meet him?
-Great! Sure.

176
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:43,534
-My father helped him with his career.
-He did?

177
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:44,702

Please, Michael. Tell me.

182
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:34,126
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

183
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:37,129
with a big bandleader.

184
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:41,425
And as his career got better and better ,
he wanted to get out of it.

185
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:45,179
Johnny is my father's godson.

186
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:48,599
My father went to see this bandleader.

187
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:52,603
He offered him $ 10 ,000
to let Johnny go,

188
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:55,439
but the bandleader said no.

189
00:19:55,564 --> 00:20:00,903
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

190
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:04,907
Within an hour ,

191
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,454
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1 ,000.

192
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:16,460
-How did he do that?
-Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

193
00:20:18,128 --> 00:20:23,008
-What was that?
-Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

194
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:28,305
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

195
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,979

a very sacred, close relationship.

We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her , to make her a big star.

man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

305

She was young and innocent!

She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

310
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:42,938

to be made to look ridiculous!

that's great¤, but narcotics is the future.

going to be, Pop?

I need a million dollars in cash.

345
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:55,523
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

-What is the interest for my family?
-30%.

347
00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:05,074
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

348
00:36:05,158 --> 00:36:07,118
And then it would go up.

349

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,055

That's right.

Why do I deserve this generosity?

And I'll give you my reason.

362

It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

363
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:23,820
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

364
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:29,534

but drugs is a dirty business.

01:59:41,419 --> 01:59:43,588
But you needed a drink first.

1005
01:59:45,924 --> 01:59:47,175
Yeah.

1006
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:52,972
Well, now you've had your drink.

1007
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:02,440
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1008
02:00:19,457 --> 02:00:22,001
I want no inquiries made.

1009
02:00:26,464 --> 02:00:29,008
I want no acts of vengeance.

1010
02:00:30,718 --> 02:00:33,555
I want you to arrange a meeting

1011
02:00:34,556 --> 02:00:37,183
with the heads of the five families.

1012
02:00:39,143 --> 02:00:41,187
This war stops now.

1013
02:01:03,167 --> 02:01:05,670
Call Bonasera.

1014
02:01:05,795 --> 02:01:07,964
I need him now.

1015
02:01:20,351 --> 02:01:25,481
This is Tom Hagen.  calling
for Vito Corleone, at his request.

1016
02:01:25,565 --> 02:01:27,984
You owe your Don a service.

<i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>

1018
02:01:31,738 --> 02:01:36,034
<i>He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>

1019
02:01:57,221 --> 02:02:02,018
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

1020
02:02:02,101 --> 02:02:05,229
Yes. What do you want me to do?

1021
02:02:13,571 --> 02:02:18,076
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

1022
02:02:22,246 --> 02:02:25,124
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1023
02:02:41,224 --> 02:02:44,268
Look how they massacred my boy.

This place has become
too dangerous for you.

1037
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:11,564
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

Is your wife coming with you?

No, take her to her father's house

VITO: Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

1058
02:06:24,322 --> 02:06:29,160
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

1059
02:06:30,953 --> 02:06:34,081
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

1060
02:06:34,165 --> 02:06:37,460
and from Brooklyn

1061
02:06:39,128 --> 02:06:41,172
Philip Tattaglia.

1062
02:06:42,965 --> 02:06:45,676
And from Staten Island

1063
02:06:45,801 --> 02:06:49,263
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1064
02:06:49,347 --> 02:06:54,977
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

1065
02:06:55,102 --> 02:06:58,814
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

1066
02:07:05,655 --> 02:07:09,116
How did things ever get so far?

1067
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:10,826
I don't know.

1068
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:16,374
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

1069
02:07:19,502 --> 02:07:22,964
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

1070
02:07:25,383 --> 02:07:28,803
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

1071
02:07:28,886 --> 02:07:32,890
then  willing to let things go on
as before.

1072
02:07:38,062 --> 02:07:43,484
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

1073
02:07:43,567 --> 02:07:47,655
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

1074
02:07:47,738 --> 02:07:51,909
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

1075
02:07:52,034 --> 02:07:54,912
He refused to share them.

1076
02:07:54,996 --> 02:07:58,749
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1077
02:07:58,874 --> 02:08:01,210
All of you know me.

1078
02:08:02,169 --> 02:08:07,341
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

1079
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:14,849
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

1080
02:08:14,932 --> 02:08:19,186
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

1081
02:08:19,270 --> 02:08:25,234
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

1082
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:30,031
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

1083
02:08:30,114 --> 02:08:34,368
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1084
02:08:34,452 --> 02:08:39,540
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

1085
02:08:39,623 --> 02:08:41,834
Times have changed.

1086
02:08:41,959 --> 02:08:46,714
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

1087
02:08:46,797 --> 02:08:49,633
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1088
02:08:49,759 --> 02:08:55,139
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

1089
02:08:55,264 --> 02:08:59,810
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

1090
02:09:00,895 --> 02:09:04,482
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

1091
02:09:04,607 --> 02:09:07,151
After all, we're not communists.

1092
02:09:10,279 --> 02:09:13,365
I also don't believe in drugs.

1093
02:09:13,491 --> 02:09:18,329
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1094
02:09:18,454 --> 02:09:21,582
Somebody says to them
" I have powders. "

1095
02:09:21,665 --> 02:09:25,169
" If you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment,

1096
02:09:25,294 --> 02:09:27,755
we can make 50 ,000 distributing. "

1097
02:09:29,173 --> 02:09:35,179
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

1098
02:09:35,262 --> 02:09:40,017
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

1099
02:09:40,142 --> 02:09:41,936
<i>That's an infàmia.</i>

1100
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:47,191
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

1101
02:09:47,274 --> 02:09:50,444
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

1102
02:09:57,034 --> 02:10:00,663
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1103
02:10:02,039 --> 02:10:08,712
And  willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

1104
02:10:09,296 --> 02:10:13,801
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1105
02:10:13,884 --> 02:10:18,222
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

1106
02:10:18,347 --> 02:10:22,059
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1107
02:10:22,184 --> 02:10:25,479
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger ,

1108
02:10:25,563 --> 02:10:28,149
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1109
02:10:28,232 --> 02:10:33,404
BARZINI : We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

1110
02:10:33,529 --> 02:10:36,407
You talk about vengeance.

1111
02:10:36,490 --> 02:10:39,743
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

1112
02:10:39,827 --> 02:10:42,329
Or my boy to me?

1113
02:10:42,413 --> 02:10:45,207
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1114
02:10:48,002 --> 02:10:50,337
But I have selfish reasons.

1115
02:10:52,590 --> 02:10:56,177
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

1116
02:10:58,053 --> 02:11:00,598
because of this Sollozzo business.

1117
02:11:02,183 --> 02:11:06,020
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1118
02:11:06,103 --> 02:11:08,772
Cleared of all these false charges.

1119
02:11:10,232 --> 02:11:13,402
But  a superstitious man.

1120
02:11:13,527 --> 02:11:18,782
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer¤,

1121
02:11:20,201 --> 02:11:23,787
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1122
02:11:23,871 --> 02:11:26,707
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1123
02:11:27,958 --> 02:11:31,587
then  going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1124
02:11:33,255 --> 02:11:35,591
And that I do not forgive.

1125
02:11:38,052 --> 02:11:40,429
But, that aside

1126
02:11:43,474 --> 02:11:45,893
let me say that I swear

1127
02:11:47,478 --> 02:11:50,606
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1128
02:11:50,731 --> 02:11:55,069
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1129
02:12:20,594 --> 02:12:26,058
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1130
02:12:26,141 --> 02:12:28,227
Mention it. Don't insist.

1131
02:12:30,229 --> 02:12:35,150
-Barzini will know without being told.
-You mean Tattaglia.

1132
02:12:36,777 --> 02:12:38,737
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1133
02:12:39,822 --> 02:12:42,950
He could never have outfought Santino.

1134
02:12:45,327 --> 02:12:50,916
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1135
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:08,475
Come on, Nancy.

1136
02:13:09,685 --> 02:13:12,271
Keep together , everyone. Brian.

1137
02:13:13,605 --> 02:13:15,274
Okay, all right.

1138
02:13:28,329 --> 02:13:30,539
How long have you been back?

1139
02:13:31,332 --> 02:13:33,167
I've been back a year.

1140
02:13:34,585 --> 02:13:36,712
Longer than that, I think.

1141
02:13:39,548 --> 02:13:41,717
It's good to see you, Kay.

1142
02:13:52,728 --> 02:13:55,272
working for my father now, Kay.

1143
02:13:57,775 --> 02:14:00,778
He's been sick. Very sick.

1144
02:14:02,321 --> 02:14:04,281
But you're not like him.

1145
02:14:04,365 --> 02:14:08,160
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1146
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:14,416
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1147
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:18,003
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1148
02:14:19,171 --> 02:14:21,632
Like a senator or president.

1149
02:14:21,715 --> 02:14:24,176
-How naive you sound.
-Why?

1150
02:14:24,259 --> 02:14:27,054
They don't have men killed.

1151
02:14:30,265 --> 02:14:32,267
Who's being naive, Kay?

1152
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:37,815
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1153
02:14:39,358 --> 02:14:43,737
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1154
02:14:45,572 --> 02:14:49,535
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1155
02:14:50,953 --> 02:14:54,081
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1156
02:14:55,416 --> 02:15:00,254
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1157
02:15:00,337 --> 02:15:03,841
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1158
02:15:03,924 --> 02:15:07,761
-Please stop it, Michael.
-Because... I want you to marry me.

1159
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:12,057
-It's too late.
-Please, Kay...

1160
02:15:13,767 --> 02:15:17,688
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1161
02:15:19,523 --> 02:15:23,777
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1162
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:28,574
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1163
02:15:30,159 --> 02:15:32,870
That we have children. Our children.

1164
02:15:34,371 --> 02:15:36,540
Kay, I need you.

1165
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,085
And I love you.

1166
02:16:02,191 --> 02:16:05,986
TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel
my territory and we do nothing about it!

1167
02:16:06,111 --> 02:16:09,740
-Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
-M ICHAEL: Be patient.

1168
02:16:09,823 --> 02:16:12,951
TESSIO:  not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1169

CARLO: We must protect ourselves.

-Let me recruit some new men.
-M ICHAEL: No.

1171
02:16:19,791 --> 02:16:23,670
-Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
-TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong.

CLEMENZA: Don Corleone...

1173
02:16:27,466 --> 02:16:31,553
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1174
02:16:31,637 --> 02:16:35,682
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1175
02:16:36,683 --> 02:16:39,394
Michael is now head of the family.

1176
02:16:39,478 --> 02:16:43,732
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1177
02:16:43,815 --> 02:16:46,235
After we make the move to Nevada

1178
02:16:46,318 --> 02:16:50,697
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1179
02:16:50,781 --> 02:16:55,118
-TESSIO: How long will that be?
-Six months.

1180
02:16:55,202 --> 02:16:58,455
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1181
02:16:58,539 --> 02:17:01,375
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1182
02:17:01,458 --> 02:17:07,130
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1183
02:17:07,214 --> 02:17:10,133
-Do you have faith in my judgment?
-Yes.

1184
02:17:10,217 --> 02:17:13,136
-Do I have your loyalty?
-Always, Godfather.

1185
02:17:13,262 --> 02:17:16,515
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

When we make our move there,
you'll be my right -hand man.

Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1192
02:17:43,625 --> 02:17:48,338
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1193
02:18:08,358 --> 02:18:12,195
-Thank you, Papa.
- happy for you, Carlo.

1198
02:18:30,505 --> 02:18:35,677
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

02:18:35,761 --> 02:18:39,890
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1201
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:50,525
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

and settling here.

Moe will sell us his share of the casino

Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.
